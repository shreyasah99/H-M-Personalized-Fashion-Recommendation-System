# 👗 H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendation System

A hybrid recommendation engine built for the **H&M Kaggle Challenge**, leveraging transactional, customer, and product metadata to generate personalized product suggestions. This system combines collaborative filtering, popularity-based heuristics, and customer-specific behavioral analysis, achieving a public leaderboard score of **0.0243 MAP@12**.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

To develop a scalable fashion recommendation system that predicts the next 12 articles a customer is most likely to purchase based on their past purchase behavior, item popularity, and user segmentation — all within the constraints of massive-scale retail data.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset provided by H&M contains:
- 🧾 **Transactions**: Purchase history of ~30M transactions
- 🧍 **Customer Info**: Demographics like age, postal code
- 👕 **Articles**: Metadata (product type, color, price, image path)
- 📷 **Images**: Product images used in visual modeling (not in final ensemble)

---

## 🧠 Algorithms and Models Used

The final recommendations are generated by **ensembling multiple strategies**, each contributing weighted scores:

| # | Method                                                                 | MAP@12  | Weight |
|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Last Purchase + Other Colors                                           | 0.0232  | 1.2    |
| 2 | Trending Articles (Overall)                                           | 0.0231  | 0.88   |
| 3 | Trending Products Weekly                                              | 0.0223  | 0.08   |
| 4 | Customer Age + "Who Bought This Also Bought"                         | 0.0225  | 0.07   |
| 5 | Collaborative Filtering (Implicit Matrix)                             | 0.0223  | 0.05   |
| 6 | Customer Price Group Preferences                                      | 0.0221  | 0.05   |

💡 The final ensemble boosted performance by combining diverse signals from price patterns, age-based trends, and collaborative similarity.
